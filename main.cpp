 * Description: Recieves input from user for the size of the shape ("length"). The program enters a do-while loop once "length"
 *              is entered. The user is then asked what shape they would like to create. The user's options are enumerated
 *              variables ("Square", "Triangle", "Pentagon", "Sentence", and "Quit") of the data type "Shape". The shape is
 *              created and user is asked if they want to continue. If yes, the do-while loop will continue. If no, the do-while
 *              loop will terminate and the program will exit, displaying an exit message.
